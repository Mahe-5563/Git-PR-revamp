# GitHub Pull Request page revamp

I have used Modular CSS for the styling.

I haven't done anything fancy. Jus tried to replicate the PR page with most of the GitHub design colors.
Enter the URL in the input field and hit Enter to view the list of PRs. By default you will see Open PRs.

Hover for labels and author names are coded.

> Nothing special to execute to run the code. Jus `npm install` and `npm start`!
